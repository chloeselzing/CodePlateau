        <h3>Subjects of study</h3>
        <p>
            At the Awesome Science Faculty, we have a pretty open-minded research facility- as long as the subjects fall <br>
            somewhere in the realm of science and technology. You seem like an intelligent, dedicated researcher, and just <br>
            the kind of person wed like to have on our team. Saying that, of the ideas you submitted we were most intrigucd <br>
            by are as follows, in order of priority:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Turning H20 into wine, and the health benefits of Resveratrol (C14H203)</li>
            <li>Measuring the effect on performance of funk bassplayers at temperatures exceeding 30°C (86°F), when the <br>
            audience size exponentially increases (effect of 3 x 10 increasing to 3x 10)
            </li>
            <li>HTML and CSS constructs for representing musical scores.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            So please can you provide more information on each of these subjects, including how long you'd expect the <br>
            research to take, required staff and other resources, and anything else you think we'd need to know? Thanks. <br>
        </p>
        <h3>Exotic dance moves</h3>
        <p>
            Yes, you are right! As part of my post-doctorate work, l dd study exotie tribal dances. lo answer your question,<br>            my favourite dances are as follows, with definitions:
        </p>
        Polynesian chicken dance <br>
        <p class="indent">
            A little known but very influential dance dating back as far as 300BC, a whole village would dance around  <br>
            in a circle like chickens, to encourage their livestock to be "fruitful".  <br>         
        </p>
        <br>
            Icelandic brownian shuffle
        <br>
         <p class="indent">
            Before the lcelanders developed fire as a means of getting warm, they used to practice this dance, which <br>
            involved hudding close together in a circle on the toor, and shutfing their bodies around in imperceptibly <br>
            tiny, very rapid movements. One of my fellow students used to say that he thought this dance inspired <br>
            modern styles such as Twerking.
         </p>
        <br>

            Arctic robot dance
        <br>
        <p class="indent">
            An interesting example of historic misinformation, English explorers in the 1960s believed to have <br>
            discovered a new dance style characterised by "robotic", stilted movements, being practiced by inhabitants <br>
            of Northerm Alaska and Canada. Later on however it was discovered that they were just moving like this <br>
            because they were really cold.  <br>
